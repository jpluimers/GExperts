The GExperts source code is provided under an Open Source license to
encourage users to contribute bug fixes and new features.  A basic
introduction to the source code is given below the compilation steps.
For the rules reguarding the usage of our source code, see License.txt
and the FAQs on our web site.

Compiling the Source Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Open one of the the following projects from the Source directory:
    GExpertsDelphi2007.dproj  Delphi 2007
    GExpertsBDS2006.dpr       BDS 2006
    GExpertsDelphi2005.dpr    Delphi 2005 (Delphi 9)
    GExpertsD8.dpr            Delphi 8 (See: http://cc.borland.com/ccweb.exe/listing?id=21448)
    GExpertsD7.dpr            Delphi 7
    GExpertsD6.dpr            Delphi 6

  Prior IDE versions are not supported.  In most cases, you can build
  the dll now and install it into the registry, but please continue reading
  below if you experience problems or want to customize your build.

- Ensure the following directories exist on the projects search path:
  in the Project Options dialog:
  - Framework;..\ExternalSource;..\ExternalSource\Abbrevia;

- Open Project | Options
  - On the Packages page, check the "Build with runtime packages"
    item

  - Add these packages to the project's runtime package list
    (required to access various internal IDE units such as ToolsAPI):
      rtl;vcl;vclx;designide;vclsmp

  - On the Linker page, enter a value of $06000000 for Image Base
    (this should allow for efficient loading of the GExperts DLL)

  - If you do not want to see Debug Window and other debugging messages,
    turn off compiler debug information under Project Options.
    
  - You should turn off the compiler option for Complete Boolean
    Evaluation but leave on assertions, range checks, overflow checks,
    IO checks, etc. 

- If you want to compile GExperts with SynEdit text editor, edit
  Source\Framework\GX_CondDefine.inc as described there.  Some
  of the experts require that component.  You may have to edit the
  global library path for successful compilation.

- Build the project and install the resulting DLL into the IDE using
  the registry editor "Regedit.exe" as described in the included
  Readme.txt file (remove any older versions of GExperts first)

- To build the GExperts Debug Window, compile the project
     Source\StandAlone\DebugWindow\GExpertsDebugWindow.dpr
  GExperts Debug Window does NOT work under Linux.
  Do the same for ExpertManager.dpr, GExpertsGrep.dpr, CodeLibrarian.dpr if you would like to
  have stand-alone versions of these experts.

NOTE: If, while opening forms at runtime or designtime, you get
errors stating things like "Property XXX does not exist", you need to
open all of the relevant GExperts forms in your IDE before compiling.
When you get the same errors at designtime, ignore them, re-save
the form, and then compile again.  This nuisance is caused by the fact
that a subsequent version of the IDE you are using did not supply a
default value for a newly added property, making the form incompatible
with older IDE versions.


Introduction to the Source Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The units that comprise the core of GExperts are present in the
Source\Framework directory as follows:

  * GX_GExperts.pas
      The "main" expert that is installed into the IDE and creates all of
      the other experts, loads settings, etc.

  * GX_Experts.pas
      The base class for all of the GExperts experts.

  * GX_EditorExpertManager.pas
      All editor experts (comment/uncomment expert, for instance)
      are created and maintained by this manager

  * GX_Configure.pas
      This is the main GUI configuration dialog.

  * GX_EditorChangeServices.pas
      Provide notification of IDE events such as edit windows being created,
      modified, or destroyed and forms being modified.

  * GX_EditorFormServices.pas
      Allows experts to get direct access to the editor windows and tracks
      creation/focusing of new editor windows for you.  GExperts uses this
      to add toolbars to edit windows.

  * GX_ActionBroker.pas
      Creates and maintains actions that are globally visible to the IDE.
      If you request an action using this broker, your action can appear on
      the IDE and GExperts editor toolbars.

  * GX_KbdShortCutBroker.pas
      Registers keyboard shortcuts with the IDE so they actually work.
      Allows requesting keyboard shortcuts with/without an associated action.

  * \SampleExperts directory
      Contains Delphi/C++ example experts and an example editor
      expert that you can customize when creating new experts.

  * \Utils directory
     Utility units with functions that are useful to several experts and
     make GExperts programming easier:

     * GX_OtaUtils.pas - General Open Tools API helper functions to get
         various interfaces like the current project, editor, etc.  Includes
         functions to get/set the selected text, insert text into the editor,
         see is a file is open, and tons of other stuff.
     * GX_GenericUtils.pas - Generic utilities such as string manipulation,
         file/path manipulation, form/component functions, and error handling.
     * GX_GxUtils.pas - GExperts-specific functions not related to the OTA.
         Includes package functions, bitmap functions, etc.
     * GX_IdeUtils.pas - Provides direct access to the IDE without using the
         Open Tools API.  Access the Component Palette, Object Inspector, etc.
     * GX_GenericClasses.pas - Classes to hold objects, create singletons, etc.

Most of the other units are specific to individual experts.  The expert
that uses them should be fairly obvious from the file name or the file
contents.  If you don't know which file contains a specific window, you
can grep the DFM/source files for the window's caption.


Localization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to localize the GExperts source code for different
international environments, refer to the IDE documentation under

 Programming with Delphi: Creating international applications
 Programming with C++Builder: Creating international applications

as well as the relevant Borland.com newsgroups at

  nntp://forums.borland.com/

and their archives at

  http://groups.google.com/

Specific to the localization of GExperts are the following items:

- Load the GExperts project into your IDE

- Make sure that your project has been built with a detailed MAP file
  (Project | Options --> Linker page)

- Choose File | New.  In the dialog, select the item: Resource DLL Wizard
  Note: Some versions of Delphi and C++Builder do not ship with this wizard

- Follow the steps in the wizard

- Translate all items of the localization project

Please tell me what your experiences are (positive or negative), and
if you make any interesting changes, please pass them on to us.
